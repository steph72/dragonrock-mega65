     obezna, dragon of mistrust
     -------------------------- 

iT IS RUMORED THAT THIS EVIL BEAST HAS
ITS LAIR SOMEWHERE IN THE SOUTHWESTERN 
GRANITE CAVES, NEAR THE CITY OF hOMPART. 
tHERE, IT COMMANDS A SMALL ARMY OF 
KOBOLDS TO DO ITS BIDDING.

uSUALLY, oBEZNA ONLY LEAVES HER HOME TO
DO DIRTY WORK FOR OTHER, MORE RESPECTED
CREATURES OF EVIL, BUT OCCASIONALLY 
SHE CAN BE SEEN SCOURING THE COUNTRYSIDE 
FOR FOOD OR SHINY OBJECTS WHICH SHE 
STEALS FROM MERCHANT'S CARAVANS CROSSING 
THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF hOMPART.

iT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT oBEZNA IS 
CLOSE FRIENDS WITH gERULDA, THE FABLED
GREAT EGO DRAGON. bUT SINCE IT HAS BEEN 
ESTABLISHED THAT EGO DRAGONS ARE
NOT CAPABLE OF REAL FRIENDSHIP, THESE 
IDEAS REMAIN A MYTH.
