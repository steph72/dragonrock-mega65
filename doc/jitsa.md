# JITSA

This project was proudly brought to you using the JITSA development model.

You may employ JITSA for your own projects free of charge. If you release a JITSA-enabled project, I kindly ask you to include this file along with it, so that other people may learn of the power of JITSA.

## "That's great, but just what is JITSA?"

JITSA is a software development model, just like Scrum. Or rather, not at all like Scrum. I wouldn't go as far as to say that it's the opposite of Scrum, because Scrum has many good ideas... but it's certainly different.

JITSA is the abbreviation for "**J**ust **I**mplement **T**hat **S**hit **A**lready". It was conceived during hours and hours of endless and meaningless meetings, retros, refinements and what-have-yous, burning tons of company money and getting nowhere slowly.

It is rooted in the realization that in modern software development methodologies, people often rather spend their time talking about their work than acutally getting any work done. SCRUM & Co. are nice ideas, but unfortunately they encourage such behaviour.

If you, like me, have learned your craft back in the golden days of writing C64 and Amiga Intros and hacking your way into the (newly invented) WWW, this mode of work can be depressing to say the least. So I tried to come up with an alternative to the so-called 12 principles of agile programming... by writing my own 12 principles which address some of the things that are going horribly wrong with Scrum.

Here they are:

## JITSA principles

1. Complete customer ignorance. Because we're doing this shit exclusively for ourselves, and not for some puffed up suits who have no idea what the world needs or wants.

2. Requirement changes late in development are a sure sign of business people being involved in our shit. We don't want business people involved in our shit (see: 4)

3. We deliver working shit when it's fucking ready.

4. Absolutely no effing cooperation between business people and developers, because nobody needs business people.

5. Projects are built around the fact that we want to get this shit running, damnit.

6. Sitting down and just implementing that shit already is the best form of communication.

7. A shit's pure awesomeness is the primary measure of progress

8. Maintaining a constant pace is for losers and accountants. If you need to sit down for three days to think about how to make this shit work, then by all means do just that. And then just implement that shit already.

9. "Technical excellence" and "good design" are lame buzzwords for people who don't know how to fill their time sheets. Todays good design is tomorrows legacy technology. We simply want our shit to be awesome. Give it your best, but don't let fads like reactive programming dictate your doings.

10. Just implementing that shit already (as opposed to reading long essays written by people who never coded even once in their lives) is essential.

11. Best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from people who just implement that shit already.

12. Regularly, the team gets intoxicated on beer or mate or grass or whatever your preferred poison might be. Then, they talk about the awesome time they had by just implementing that shit already, and how to have an even better time.
