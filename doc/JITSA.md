# JITSA

This project was proudly brought to you using the JITSA development model.

You may employ JITSA for your own projects free of charge. If you release a JITSA-enabled project, I kindly ask you to include this file along with it, so that other people may learn of the power of JITSA.

## "That's great, but just what is JITSA?"

JITSA is a software development model, just like Scrum. Or rather, not at all like Scrum. I wouldn't go as far as to say that it's the opposite of Scrum, because Scrum has a few good ideas... but it's certainly different.

JITSA is the abbreviation for "**J**ust **I**mplement **T**hat **S**hit **A**lready". It was conceived during hours and hours of endless and meaningless meetings, retros, refinements, shitshiftings and other assorted what-have-yous, burning tons of company money and getting nowhere slowly.

It is rooted in the realization that in modern software development methodologies, people often rather spend their time talking about their work than acutally getting any work done. Scrum & co. surely come with the best intentions, but unfortunately they encourage such behaviour. 

In fact, most of this text was actually written down while overpaid people in suits conducted endless discussions about whether their front end developers should develop their backend because the same overpaid people in suits completely screwed up their team structure... only to scrap the whole project in the end and "go crossplatform" with flutter or some shit like that (which of course didn't solve any of the actual problems).

If you - like me - have learned your craft back in the golden days of writing C64 and Amiga Intros and hacking your way into the (newly invented) WWW, this mode of work can be terribly frustrating, to say the least. So I tried to come up with an alternative to the so-called 12 principles of agile programming... by writing my own 12 principles which address some of the things that are going horribly wrong with Scrum.

Here they are:

(it might be helpful to have [a copy of the original 12 principles of agile programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/) alongside of this, to get the references)

## JITSA principles

1. Complete customer ignorance. Customers suck. There's no customer. Because we're doing this shit exclusively for ourselves, and not for some puffed up suits who have no idea what the world needs or wants.

2. Requirement changes late in development are a sure sign of business people being involved in our shit. We don't want business people involved in our shit (see: 4)

3. We deliver working shit when it's fucking ready. Not after that, and certainly not before that. If it takes another three months, so be it. There's no need to calm down product owners or investors with shiny trinkets and baubles. Just do what has to be done in the time that it takes.

4. Absolutely no effing cooperation between business people and developers, because nobody needs business people.

5. Projects are built around the fact that we want to get this shit running, damnit.

6. Sitting down and just implementing that shit already is the best form of communication.

7. A shit's pure awesomeness is the primary measure of progress. 

8. Maintaining a constant pace is for accountants and other overpaid losers with suits. If you need to sit down for three days to think about how to make this shit work, then by all means do just that. And then just implement that shit already.

9. "Technical excellence" and "good design" are lame buzzwords for people who don't know how to fill their time sheets. Todays good design is tomorrows legacy technology. We simply want our shit to be awesome. Give it your best, and don't let snake oil merchants selling fads like flutter and reactve programming dictate your doings.

10. Just implementing that shit already (as opposed to reading long essays written by people who never coded even once in their lives) is essential.

11. Best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from people who just implement that shit already.

12. Regularly, the team gets intoxicated on beer or mate or grass or whatever your preferred poison might be. Then, they talk about the awesome time they had by just implementing that shit already, and how to have an even better time.


Of course JITSa doesn't work in every situation, most probably it won't even work for most teams. But nothing beats coming home after a day of doing nothing, leaving all the bullshit behind, sitting down and just implementing that shit already. Trust me.
